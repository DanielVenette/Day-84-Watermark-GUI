# Image Watermark GUI

Welcome to my Image Watermark-GUI project, a Python-based GUI application for watermarking images. The application was developed by [DanielVenette](https://github.com/DanielVenette) and allows you to select an image, enter a watermark text, adjust its opacity and rotation, and finally save the watermarked image in PNG format.

## Features

1. Intuitive GUI for selecting and watermarking images.
2. Customizable watermark text with adjustable opacity and rotation.
3. Watermarked images saved in PNG format.

This application requires the following Python libraries:
- tkinter
- PIL (Pillow)

1. Open your terminal.
2. Navigate to the cloned repository or your project directory.
3. Run `python -m pip install pillow`

This command will install the Pillow library, which is a fork of PIL (Python Imaging Library) and is more actively maintained.
